[# Tiimo vs Amazing Marvin: Which ADHD & Autism-Friendly Task Manager is Right for You?

*Published: August 3, 2025 | Reading time: 8 minutes*

If you're neurodivergent and drowning in a sea of productivity apps that just don't "get" your brain, you're not alone. Today we're diving deep into two apps specifically designed with ADHD, autism, and executive dysfunction in mind: **Tiimo** and **Amazing Marvin**.

Both have passionate user bases, but they take completely different approaches to helping neurodivergent brains stay organized. Let's break down which one might be your perfect productivity partner.

## What is Tiimo?

Tiimo is a visual daily planner that's become the go-to app for many in the neurodivergent community. With over 500,000 users and recognition as an Apple Design Awards Finalist 2024, Tiimo focuses on one core principle: **visual scheduling**.

### Key Tiimo Features:
- **Visual timeline interface** with color-coded activities
- **Customizable icons and themes** for different task types  
- **Focus timer** with visual progress tracking
- **AI task breakdown** (Pro version) to split overwhelming tasks
- **Routine templates** for common daily patterns
- **Widget support** for at-a-glance schedule viewing
- **Accessibility features** including voice-over support

Tiimo's philosophy is beautifully simple: if you can see your day laid out visually, you're more likely to follow through. No complex systems, no overwhelming features – just your day, visualized.

## What is Amazing Marvin?

Amazing Marvin takes the opposite approach: **ultimate customization**. Rather than providing a single workflow, Marvin lets you build your perfect productivity system from dozens of modular "strategies" that you can toggle on and off.

### Key Amazing Marvin Features:
- **100% customizable interface** with modular strategies

Marvin's motto could be "your productivity system, exactly how you need it." Nothing more, nothing less.
