Anyone else feel like time is this mysterious force that just... doesn't make sense? Like, I'll sit down to do "one quick thing" and suddenly it's 3 hours later and I haven't eaten lunch?

Turns out this isn't just me being rubbish at adulting, there's actual neurological research behind why we experience time differently!

## Some Cool Brain Science

People with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders have differences in their prefrontal cortex that can hinder time management skills and other executive functions. In both ASD and ADHD, time blindness is thought to arise from differences in brain function and structure, particularly in areas involved in executive functions, attention and time perception.

## What's Actually Happening

Time blindness refers to difficulties in perceiving, estimating and managing time, it's not laziness or lack of caring! Our executive functioning (frontal cortex) can manifest as difficulty understanding and following schedules, sequencing events and how actions relate to one another (like their order and duration).

Understanding that my brain literally processes time differently has helped me stop beating myself up and start finding strategies that actually work WITH my neurodivergent brain rather than against it.

What's your biggest time management struggle? Have you found any strategies that work for your specific type of brain?
