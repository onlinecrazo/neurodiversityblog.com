Can we talk about how absolutely WILD it is that we're still being sold "one-size-fits-all" productivity systems when people diagnosed with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders have differences in their prefrontal cortex that can hinder time management skills and other executive functions?

Like, imagine telling someone with glasses that they just need to "try harder" to see clearly. That's essentially what happens when neurotypical productivity gurus tell us to "just use a planner" or "batch your tasks."

## Here's What's Actually Happening in Our Brains

In both ASD and ADHD, time blindness is thought to arise from differences in brain function and structure, particularly in areas involved in executive functions, attention, and time perception. Recent 2024 research shows that those of us who are autistic and/or ADHD have altered neural processes that impact how our prefrontal cortex manages these executive functions.

## The Controversial Bit

Most time management apps are designed by and for neurotypical brains. They assume you can estimate task duration, maintain consistent energy levels, and switch between tasks seamlessly. But when timing is linked to working memory, planning, and attention; all skills that neurodivergent people may find challenging, these tools often make us feel MORE broken, not less.

## The Plot Twist

Results from 36 eligible studies revealed that ADHD and ASD showed more difficulties than the typical development group in tests and, particularly, in questionnaires - meaning traditional assessment methods might not even capture how we actually function in real life.

It's time we stopped trying to force square pegs into round holes and started designing systems that work WITH our neurological differences, not against them.

## What This Means for You

Understanding that your brain literally processes time differently isn't an excuse - it's **liberation**. It means:

- Your struggles with time aren't character flaws
- You need different strategies, not more willpower  
- Traditional productivity advice isn't designed for your brain
- There are research-backed alternatives that actually work

## Real Talk Time

What time management tools are you currently using (if any)? Do they actually work for your brain, or do they make you feel like you're constantly failing? 

I'm genuinely curious because there's a massive gap between what's available and what we actually need.
